# models/

This folder is intended to store trained model weights such as `best.pt`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Note on Model Files

Large model files like `best.pt` are **not included in this repository** because they are typically very large and can exceed GitHub's file size limits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Use

1. Download the trained model `best.pt` from the following link:  
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gm61wRuZGb5hpDLnQ74voFnjzi_Httyb/view?usp=drive_link

2. Place the downloaded `best.pt` file inside this `models/` folder.

3. Run your code as usual; it will load the model from this location.
